The Artisan console's make commands are used to create a variety of classes, such as controllers, jobs, 
migrations, and tests. These classes are generated using "stub" files that are populated with values based on 
your input. However, you may want to make small changes to files generated by Artisan. 
To accomplish this, you may use the stub:publish command to publish the most common stubs to your application 
so that you can customize them:

>>php artisan stub:publish

The published stubs will be located within a stubs directory in the root of your application. 
Any changes you make to these stubs will be reflected when you generate their corresponding classes
 using Artisan's make commands.
